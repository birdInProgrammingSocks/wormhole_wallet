Wormhole Wallet Release v1.3.1

Tired of chasing down corpses for their precious money, only to arrive too late? Tired of mods that remove the despawn timer, but end up wrecking your filesize during long runs when your world is full of nuggets that don't despawn?

Well, no more! The alchemists have been hard at work, and their latest invention is finally ready for you to use! The Wormhole Wallet channels quantum tunneling to instantaneously teleport any gold nuggets that drop directly to your inventory, and it even works with blood nuggets! Furthermore, it will replace any perk that it makes useless with something a little more useful.

For the low, low price of FREE, (also telling me if something breaks) you too can experience the convenience that comes with the Wormhole Wallet's technomagical innovations!

v1.3.1 Release Changelog:
Apparently the last update broke the "remove useless perks" options.
Update 1.3.1 fixes that.
Not in this update, but 1.3 added perk mode, which only makes the mod's effect active when you have Gold is Forever. It's an opt-in mode which you can find in the mod settings.

Please rate if you enjoy it! As of the time of update, we have 7800 subscribers and 123 ratings with a 98% positive rate, but we can't show five stars until we reach about 200 ratings!

FAQ:

Q: This is unbalanced.
A: This is a QOL mod, designed to make things easier. However, I do have mod settings so you can adjust the amount of money and, in the case of Blood Nuggets, healing you receive from each nugget.

Q: Your mod is broken.
A: Leave a comment in the thread telling me what went wrong and how to reproduce the issue (or, at least, what you were doing when it happened), then I'll have it fixed as soon as I can get around to it.

Q: Is this compatible with ALIEN?
A: Yes, and it should be compatible with most other mods.

Q: Can you add compatibility with chests' gold drops?
A: No. Believe me, I tried. I left the code commented out, you're welcome to try to fix it yourself. If you can get it working, by all means, let me know and I'll push the update and credit you. But I've spent long enough on this.
